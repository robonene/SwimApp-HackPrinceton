# Swimming Exercise App

This is a web app that gives a way for swimmers of all levels to foster improvement. As a logged-in user, one could generate a dynamic swimming routine around the user's schedule, to which a possible algorithm would be created. Any daily routines are able to be printed as a pdf, giving a opportunity to move to the pool. A swimmer's dashboard is in development, in addition to creating an educational wiki on swimming techniques and detailed instructions for the given exercises: images and gifs possible.
