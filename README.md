# Swimming Exercise App

This is a web-based app that allows for swimmers of all levels to foster improvement. As a logged-in user, one could generate a dynamic swimming routine around the user's schedule, to which a possible algorithm could be created to shift the difficulty in a way that keeps a momentum of strength. Any daily routines created are able to be printed as a pdf, giving a opportunity to move from the computer to the pool. A swimmer's dashboard is in development, in addition to creating an educational wiki on swimming techniques and detailed instructions for the given exercises: images and gifs possible. This app is alligned to the Education track, giving a platform to learn and grow.
